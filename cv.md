## About me
I have been doing design (web and graphic) for several years. Worked both remotely and directly in the office. I began to study front-end development in order to more easily communicate with other developers, understand them and literally convey my vision of the product to them. And then I realized that I was interested in this area, so I decided to study development technologies in more depth.
